# tali-gml

tali-gml provides a lexer, parser, and interpreter for the Tali
programming language in GameMaker.

GameMaker is a surprisingly versatile and powerful application
development tool. Unfortunately, the platform's built-in
scripting language (GameMaker Language, or GML) leaves a lot to
be desired - particularly the verbosity of its standard library.

If you'd rather write Lisp than GML, then tali-gml is the project
for you!
